        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Clean Records was made to highlight stores and locations that sell second hand vinyl and CD's.</p>
        <p>I have chosen this initiative because I love music and it is a really big part of my life, and I have been collecting records for years, and I know there are loads of ppl that share that love.</p>
        <p>Collecting vinyl and CD's has had a big surge in popularity in recent years, especially with teenagers and young adults, and because buying second hand vinyl and CD's are more sustainable and better for the environment we wanted to inform people on places where they can buy those.</p>
